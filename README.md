# CRCM6-GEM5_EnergyBalance

This repository is for storing the code I have written for an internship completed during the summer of 2021 at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) under the direction of Dr. Alejandro Di Luca. The internship concerned the evaluation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model 6 - Global Environmental Multiscale 5 (CRCM6-GEM5)'s energy balance.
