def find_utc_offsets (file_pathname, nbr_of_header_rows, delimiter, station_index, utc_offset_index):

    """

    Makes a dictionary that provides UTC offsets for various stations. The keys are the station ids (country names and station name) and the values are the UTC offsets associated with the station.    


    Parameters :

        file_pathname (string)   : Absolute pathname of the file containing the UTC offsets for various stations.

        nbr_of_header_rows (int) : Number of header rows in file_pathname.

        delimiter (string)       : Delimiter used in file_pathname to seperate the variables on a line.

        station_index (int)      : Index of the station ids in file_pathname.

        utc_offset_index (int)   : Index of the UTC offsets in file_pathname.


    Returns :

        utc_offsets (dict) : Dictionary whose keys correspond to the station ids and whose values are the UTC offsets.
